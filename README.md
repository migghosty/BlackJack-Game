# BlackJack-Game
A simple game that allows you to play BlackJack with friends

The game of Blackjack is to draw cards, and get as close to 21 as possible.
The numbers 2-10 are treated as their own numbers respectively.
Jacks, Queens and Kings are all treated as 10 points.
Aces are special where they can either be 1 or 11 (depending on what is better for you).

You will start off with two cards and that gives you a certain amount of points.
You can either hit (draw a card for more points), or stand (keep your current cards).
Be careful with hitting though, because if you go over 21, you bust and lose the game.

Have fun!
